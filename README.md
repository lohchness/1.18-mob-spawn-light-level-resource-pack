Minecraft 1.18 resource pack that shows whether a mob can spawn on a block or not

Due to the light level change in Minecraft 1.18 on how mobs can spawn, I updated an old resource pack I was using.

The lightmap of the block will be **RED** if mobs can spawn.

This resource pack needs Optifine to work.

Download the zip file and add it to .minecraft/resourcepacks, then in the Minecraft program, go to Options/Resource Pack and add 1.18-MOBLL to active resource packs.
